# Chimera Firmware

Chimera 3D printer development is an ambitious project in which know-how about different additive manufacturing processes and material engineering are fused togheter. Developed at +LAB as an open source project, Chimera is not only an FDM 3D printer, but also a multiextrusion and multitecnology platform from which exploring contamination between different additive manufacturing approaches.

### Roadmap:

#### Development of a multi extrusion process platform whith curing unit

- [ ] FDM head 
- [ ] syringe extruder head
- [ ] volumetric pump head
- [ ] pneumatic extruder head
- [ ] curing head
- [ ] control of different tool head simultaneusly

#### Engineering of the 3D printer structure

- [ ] structure development
- [ ] rotating build plate
